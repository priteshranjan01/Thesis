Let's start with a few paragraph basics, here is how to make \textbf{bold}, 
and \textit{italics}, and \emph{emphasized}.  Let's say you need to cite 
something in your references, simply type \verb^\cite{key}^, which produces
\cite{einstein1935particle}.  
Some other references are \cite{golub1996matrix} and 
\cite{larsen1974asymptotic}.
Some \LaTeX{} compilers 
require a second compilation for citations and references 
to be sorted and matched properly in the resulting document.  

Here is a quotation:
\begin{quotation}
Alice, Bob and Carol are boring.  Who would even want to know their secret?
\end{quotation}

Let's say we need to make a list, try this on for size
\begin{enumerate}
  \item NCSU is great
  \item I like NCSU
  \item I really hope I can find a job when I graduate!
\end{enumerate} 

\section{Math enviroments}
\subsection{Equations}

There are many different ways to write equations, for example we could put 
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ directly into a sentence.  Or we could use the equation 
enviroment and do 
%
\begin{equation}
  a^2+b^2=c^2.
  \label{eq:one}
\end{equation} 
And from here we can later reference it by simply doing typing 
\verb^\ref{label}^, which gives \ref{eq:one}.  However, defining and using
equation and figure reference macros will ensure that the equation
references are consistent, instead of having Eq.~(1), Equation 3, Eqn 4
scattered through the thesis.  This template file defines \verb^\eref^
and \verb^\fref^ for this purpose. You can modify the macros to your liking
in the \texttt{YourName-thesis.tex} file.
For example, the command \verb^\eref{label}^ gives \eref{eq:one}.


If you don't need to reference an equation you may simply do this 
\[
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
\]

For Greek letters you must go to the math enviroments, for example 
$\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$.  Let's look at equations that cover 
multiple lines, none of these equations may be true or mean anything, but so 
that the reader can get some ideas.  In addition I will use some other useful 
notations like subscripts, superscripts, fractions, etc.  One important item 
of note is that one uses the ``ampersand" symbol to line up equations 
(also look at how I used quotations).
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma_1 & = & \alpha^{\beta} + \psi_0 \frac{\psi_1}{\psi_2+\psi_3} \label{eq.two} \\
& = & \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \ldots + \beta_k \nonumber\\
& \rightarrow & E(\gamma_2) 
\end{eqnarray}

Alternatively, one can specify a slightly different enviroment if none of 
the equations need to be numbered.  Remember that if you are planning on 
referring to them later on, you must use a ``label" statement.
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\gamma_1 & = & n^{-1/2} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \left[h(X_i,\beta_0)-E\{h(X_i,\beta_0)\}\right]\\
& \rightarrow & \hat q \pm \frac{\partial \gamma_2}{\partial \beta}. 
\end{eqnarray*}  
Lastly there may be times in which you want to use a non-italicized word 
your formula, such as an indicator function that may look like this 
$\mbox{I}\{\mu_i(1,\beta)>\mu_i(0,\beta)\}$ , if so just use the 
``mbox" statement.


You could use a multiline equation for long equations.  The environment
is \texttt{multline}.  Insert \verb^\\^ for line breaks.

\begin{multline*}
\bo \cdot \vec{\nabla} \psi(\vec{r},\bo ,E) + \Sigma_t(\vec{r},E)\psi(\vec{r},\bo ,E) = \\
  \int_{4\pi} d\bo' \int_0^{\infty} dE' \, \Sigma_s(\vec{r},\bo'\to\bo,E'\to E)\psi(\vec{r},\bo',E') + Q(\vec{r},\bo ,E),
\end{multline*}


we operate with $\displaystyle\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\,\cdot\,\right) dE$
to obtain
\begin{multline*}
  \bo \cdot \vec{\nabla} \tilde{\psi}(\vec{r},\bo)
  + \Sigma_t(\vec{r})\tilde{\psi}(\vec{r},\bo) = \\
  \int_{4\pi} d\bo' \int_0^{\infty} dE' \, \psi(\vec{r},\bo',E')
  \left [ \int_{0}^{\infty} dE \, \Sigma_s(\vec{r},\bo'\to\bo,E'\to E)
  \right ] + \tilde{Q}(\vec{r},\bo),
\end{multline*}
