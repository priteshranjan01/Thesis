\section{Multi-UAV missions and the challenges}

\textbf{Content}: Critical operations like environment sensing, disaster monitoring etc. can benefit from multi-uav clusters but there are several challenges critical for their success like real-time inter-drone communication  and autonomous control. 

\textbf{Intent}: Introduce the readers to some operations that would benefit from autonomously operating multi-UAV swarm and establish inter-drone communication as the critical challenge in success of such missions.
