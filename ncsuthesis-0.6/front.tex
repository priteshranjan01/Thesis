\begin{abstract}

In recent years, employing a cluster of small and mini UAVs for missions like border surveillance, disaster monitoring, search, and rescue operation has gained significant traction due to advantages over a single large and costlier UAV.  However, an autonomously operating multi-UAV fleet has its own set of challenges like co-operative path planning, collision avoidance, autonomous mission planning etc. A reliable communication network among the cooperating UAVs is critical to the success of a mission and is the most fundamental problem as well.

An inter UAV ad-hoc network is the most suitable option for enabling communication among the UAVs. However traditional destination IP based routing protocols impose high overhead in mobile ad-hoc networks due to node mobility which leads to frequent topology changes. Geographic routing or position-based routing protocols which take the aid of geographic locations of nodes have been demonstrated to scale better for mobile ad-hoc networks. However, most of these protocols have been designed with 2-dimensional networks in mind which are not directly applicable to 3-dimensional networks.

In this thesis, we study some geographical routing protocols and propose an extended version of our past work on geographic routing. Our proposed protocol enhances reliability by routing packets through multiple geo-diffused paths while minimizing the overhead by limiting the flooding to a specific region. We demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol among a group of quadrotor drones in Qrsim simulator working on plume wrapping problem. We have also presented statistical data on the performance evaluation of our protocol on metrics like end-to-end delay, transmission overhead, average number of hops and delivery ratio.
