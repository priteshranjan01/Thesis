\section{Flying Ad-hoc networks (FANETs)}

A wireless ad hoc network is a decentralized network of nodes where there is no specialized equipment like routers/switches/access points to facilitate communication, and the communication medium uses wireless protocols e.g. IEEE 802.11. Since there is no need to set-up any special infrastructure the network can be spun up quickly. Generally, nodes are mobile (hence termed as Mobile ad-hoc network â€“ MANET) and depending on use-cases, node type or node mobility they are further classified as Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) or Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) or Smart-phone ad hoc networks (SPANs).

Flying ad hoc networks are a subset of MANETs and consist of nodes capable of flight. The nodes have high degree of mobility, and the distance between the FANET nodes is larger as compared to MANET nodes. These nodes can be manned airplanes, unmanned guided drones or unmanned unguided drones. The span of the network also varies from few hundred meters to several kilometers. One important distinction about FANETs is that the participating nodes have a common mission and their mobility model depends on the mission \cite{OUBBATI201729}. In this section, we discuss the different characteristics, applications, advantages and challenges of FANETs.

\subsection{FANET Characteristics, Applications and Challenges}

FANETs differ from MANETs on several properties. Some of them are as follows.

\textbf{Node Type and mobility:} Typical nodes in a FANET would be unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can be further differentiated based on their size, namely, large, small and mini UAVs \cite{OUBBATI201729}. Their mobility, transmission range, altitude, speed, and energy autonomy depends accordingly on their corresponding sizes. A comparison between these types of UAVs is presented in table \ref{tab:uav_comparison} \cite{OUBBATI201729}.
